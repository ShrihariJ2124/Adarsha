Image Swap Guide

Current status:
- The site is running with available uploaded images.
- Missing photos are temporarily mapped via placeholders in `src/app/data/siteImages.ts`.

To replace images later:
1. Upload your new image files into `public/images/`.
2. Update only one file: `src/app/data/siteImages.ts`.
3. Replace placeholder paths with the new file paths.
